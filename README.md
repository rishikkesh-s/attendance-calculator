# attendance-calculator
A simple attendance calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This is a small project I made to calculate attendance percentage.  
With this calculator you can:  
- Add subjects and enter total/attended classes  
- See how many classes you can safely bunk  
- Check your current attendance percentage  
- Know how many classes you need to attend to reach the minimum requirement  

I set the default minimum attendance to **76%** for safety. You can change it if you want.

## How it works
1. Enter the minimum attendance percentage at the top.  
2. For each row, type in your **total classes** and **attended classes**.  
3. The calculator will instantly show:  
   - How many more you can bunk  
   - Your attendance percentage if you bunk those  
   - How many you need to attend continuously to be safe
   - You can add as many rows as you like  

There’s also a **help button (❓)** on the side that explains each field in case you’re confused.

## Tech used
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- Bootstrap (for basic styling)

## Why I built this
I kept getting confused about how many classes I could bunk without dropping below 76%. Instead of doing the math every time, I thought it would be easier to just make a simple tool for it.
